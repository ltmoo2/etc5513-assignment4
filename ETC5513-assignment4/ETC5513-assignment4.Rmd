\section*{Introduction}



\section*{Differences between men and women}

The disparity in the life expectancy between men and women was first recognised in the 1920's [@luy2014gender]. This section will examine this difference in detail.

The first step was to tidy the life expectancy data into a format R. The original variables were condensed into Country, Year, Type (expectancy measure), Gender and Expectancy. The first 10 resulting rows are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:transform). 

```{r transform}
expectancy_clean <- expectancy %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = `Life expectancy at birth (years)_Both sexes`:`Healthy life expectancy (HALE) at age 60 (years)_2_Female`,
               names_to = c("Type", "Gender"),
               names_sep = "_",
               values_to = "Expectancy") %>%
  mutate(Gender = if_else(Gender == "1", "Male",
                          if_else(Gender == 2, "Female", "Both"))) %>%
  rename(Country = X1_Country,
         Year = X2_Year) %>%
  mutate(Expectancy = as.numeric(Expectancy)) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year))

expectancy_clean %>%
  head(10) %>%
  kable(caption = "Life expectancy data") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "bordered"))
```

An average was then calculated across the recorded gender types for life expectancy at birth which is shown in Table \@ref(tab:average). It appears that the average life expectancy for both genders is slightly over 69 years with females having the higher value of 71.6 years and males almost 5 years lower at 66.9 years.

```{r average}
averages <- expectancy_clean %>%
  filter(str_detect(Type, "Life expectancy at birth")) %>%
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  summarise("Average Life Expectancy" = mean(Expectancy, na.rm = TRUE))

averages %>%
  kable(caption = "Average life expectancy across genders", digits = 1) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "bordered"))
```

The yearly averages were then visualised using the boxplot below in Figure \@ref(fig:box) with gender on the x-axis and the average life expectancy on the y-axis. This further illustrates that females on average have a higher life expectancy across all years in the data set, having a higher median and interquartile range than men with only the male maximum and female minimum values overlapping.

```{r box, fig.cap = "Comparison of life expectancy across genders per year"}

yearly_avg <- expectancy_clean %>%
  filter(str_detect(Type, "Life expectancy at birth")) %>%
  group_by(Gender, Year) %>%
  summarise(Average = mean(Expectancy, na.rm = TRUE))

yearly_avg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Gender,
             y = Average,
             colour = Gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("Average life expectancy")
```

A line graph was then produced with year on the x-axis and the average life expectancy on the y-axis to illustrate this trend. As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:test), across all years recorded in the data set, females have had a higher life expectancy than males by approximately the same amount.

```{r test, fig.cap = "Change in life expectancy by year for each gender"}

yearly_avg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year,
             y = Average,
             group = Gender,
             colour = Gender)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  ylab("Average Life Expectancy") +
  theme_bw()

```

A linear model was then produced to see if this trend was due to gender or year. The outputs are shown in Table \@ref(tab:linear). 

```{r linear}
library(broom)

reg_data <- yearly_avg %>%
  filter(Gender != "Both") %>%
  mutate(Year = Year-2000)

gender_reg <- lm(Average ~ Gender,
   data = reg_data)

exp_reg <-  lm(Average ~ Year,
   data = reg_data)

both_reg <- lm(Average ~ Gender + Year,
   data = reg_data)

gender_r <- glance(gender_reg) %>%
  select(r.squared, adj.r.squared) %>%
  mutate(Model = "Gender")

year_r <- glance(exp_reg) %>%
  select(r.squared, adj.r.squared) %>%
  mutate(Model = "Year")

both_r <- glance(both_reg) %>%
  select(r.squared, adj.r.squared) %>%
  mutate(Model = "Both")

reg_comp <- bind_rows(Gender = tidy(gender_reg),
          Year = tidy(exp_reg),
          Both = tidy(both_reg),
          .id = "Model") %>%
              left_join(bind_rows(gender_r, 
                      year_r, both_r),
            by = "Model") %>%
  select(Model,
         term, 
         estimate, 
         r.squared, 
         adj.r.squared)

reg_comp %>%
  kable(caption = "Model estimates for life expectancy based on gender and year", digits = 3) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "bordered"))

```

Several insights are provided from this table. Firstly, the GenderMale term for the Gender model suggests that males on average live 4.7 years less than the female average of 71.6. Secondly, the Year term for the Year model shows that for each after 2000, people on average are living 0.35 years longer. Finally the adjusted.r.squared values describes the explanatory power of these models. The results have been plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:modelcomp) with the model name on the x-axis and the adjusted r squared on the y-axis.

```{r modelcomp, fig.cap = "Comparison of model fits"}
reg_comp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Model,
             y = adj.r.squared,
             colour = Model)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  ylab("Adjusted r squared") +
  theme_bw()
```

This shows that the gender model is superior to the year mode, explaining over 64% of the variation in the life expectancy value compared to under 33% for the year variable. Interestingly, almost the entire variation in life expectancy can be explained by including both variables.

\section*{Life expectancy and Health expenditure}

```{r country, include=FALSE}
country_le <- expectancy_clean %>% 
  filter(Gender == "Both") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Type,

                                            destination = "continent")) %>%

         `Health expenditure per capita(US$)` = as.numeric(`Health expenditure per capita(US$)`),
         `Life expectancy at birth (years)` = as.numeric(`Life expectancy at birth (years)`),
         `Life expectancy at age 60 (years)` = as.numeric(`Life expectancy at age 60 (years)`))

Figure (\@ref(fig:birth), \@ref(fig:age60)) shows the dynamic relationship between life expectancy at birth(at age 60) and health expenditure from 2000 to 2016. And we find that the countries with the lowest life expectancy and health expenditure are mainly in Africa, while Europe, Oceania and some countries in the Americas are far ahead. Life expectancy in most Asian and American countries is concentrated between 65 and 75 years. Also, almost all countries have increased their spending on health over time and improved life expectancy over time.  
However, there was an outlier country in the Americas showed a significant drop in life expectancy in 2010. Combined with Table \@ref(tab:min_expectancy), we can find that this country is Haiti, which was hit by a large-scale earthquake in 2010 and killed over 230,000 people[@bilham2010lessons], which led to a significant drop in life expectancy in Haiti. Another interesting fact is that the country with the highest health expenditure is not the country with the highest life expectancy. Combine with Table \@ref(tab:min_expectancy), and we can find that the country with the highest life expectancy is in Asia, Japan. Japan has the longest life expectancy in the world mainly because of its government regulation and support for health care[@ikeda2011has].

  kable(caption = "The highest life expectancy in the Asia") %>%

## Map for average health expenditure


```{r map_world}
#read world map
map_world <- map_data("world")

```

```{r avg_he}

  summarise(average = mean(`Health expenditure per capita(US$)`)) %>% 
  # modify countries's name to match map data
  mutate(Country = recode(Country, 
    "United States of America" = "USA",
    "Antigua and Barbuda" = "Antigua",
    "Bolivia (Plurinational State of)" = "Bolivia",
    "Brunei Darussalam" = "Brunei",
    "Cabo Verde" = "Cape Verde",
    "Congo" = "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
    "Iran (Islamic Republic of)" = "Iran",
    "Lao People's Democratic Republic" = "Laos",
    "Micronesia (Federated States of)" = "Micronesia",
    "Republic of Korea" = "South Korea",

    "Syrian Arab Republic" = "Syria",
    "Trinidad and Tobago" = "Trinidad",
    "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" = "UK",
    "United Republic of Tanzania" = "Tanzania",
    "Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)" = "Venezuela",
    "Viet Nam" = "Vietnam"
  ))
  
```


```{r map_he}
#join map_world and health expenditure data
map_health_expenditure <- 
  left_join(avg_health_expenditure, map_world, by = c("Country" = "region")) 

```


```{r map_avg, fig.cap="The average health expenditure per capita(US$) by country", fig.align="center"}
# map average health expenditure
ggplot(map_health_expenditure,
       aes(x = long, 
           y = lat, 
           group = group, 
           fill = average)
       ) +
  
  geom_polygon(color = "#CCCCCC") + 
  scale_fill_gradient(name = "per capita(US$)",
                      low="white", 
                      high="steelblue",
                      limits = c(0, 10000)
                      )+
  ggtitle("The average health expenditure per by country")+
  theme_map()
  
```

By mapping Figure \@ref(fig:map_avg), it can be found that the highest per capita health expenditure is mainly in European countries, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Some countries are 0 due to missing health expenditure data.

```


From Figure (\@ref(fig:plot_birth), \@ref(fig:plot_age60)), we can see that Africa is the worst fitting one both in Model(at_birth) and Model(at_age60), while Oceania has better fitting in both. As shown in Table \@ref(tab:model_info), we infer that the Model(AT_age60) is better than Model(at_birth), because it has the higher r.squared which explains the variance in the model. Model(at_age60) explains 69.11% of the dependent variable. Also, Model(at_age60) has the lower sigma, which gives it more confidence. Finally, Model(at_age60) has the lower AIC and BIC, which makes it the best model fit[@kenny2015measuring].  

Through Table \@ref(tab:model_ci), we can get the formula of Model(at_birth) as follows:
$$\large{\hat{LifeExp(at~birth)}=57.52+0.00539Health~expenditure}$$

And the formula of Model(at_age60) can be represented by:
$$\large{\hat{LifeExp(at ~age ~60)}=13.20+0.00172Health~expenditure}$$

From the above analysis, we can learn that the amount of health expenditure per capita has a more significant impact on healthy life expectancy at age 60 than healthy life expectancy at birth. It's possibly because people are more likely to get sick as they get older and need more health care to live longer.
